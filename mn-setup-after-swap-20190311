# Temporary step by step installation instructions for a 
# manocoin masternode AFTER 
# the swap of march 11, 2019
# 
# EVERY INSTRUCTION THAT YOU USE FROM THIS DOCUMENT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK
#
# LAST WARNING - THIS IS FOR THE NEW MANOCOIN - AFTER THE SWAP OF MARCH 11 - 2019
#
#
# Used on Ubuntu 16.04 VPS on Vultr
#
# Download the new mano wallet and install it on your desktop machine: https://gitlab.com/manocoin/manocoin/tree/master/releases
#
# Start the wallet
#  
# Create a wallet address 
# File -> receiving addresses -> new
# Send 1 mano to it to test if everything is ok
# 	If that worked, good!
#
# Create a new wallet address 
# Send the collateral (new collateral for mano is exact 2500) to this new address
# 
# 		Note about collateral: mind the transfer fee! 
#		If the transfer fee is 1 and this is deducted from the 2500,
#		then only 2499 will be sent.
# 
# 		Because this amount is less then the required 2500 it will not work. Also higher amounts than 2500 will not work.
#
# 		So exactly 2500, PLUS a small amount that is exactly enough to pay for the transfer. 
#
#		(most withdraw/send software propose the required amount for the transaction)
#
# Create a private key:
#  open the debug console:
#  Menu -> tools -> debug console
#  Type: 
# masternode genkey

#  The command outputs a string, which is your private key - looking something like this:
#  93HaYCVGAUC88HF32223BGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg
#  Copy this key somewhere, you need it later.
#
#
# Installing the daemon on the VPS
# Open up a terminalwindow to your VPS (with putty)
# If you aren't already, go to your home directory (/root/ in my case) 
cd ~

# Download the zip file containing the daemon and the cli from the gitlab repository:
wget https://gitlab.com/manocoin/manocoin/raw/master/releases/mano-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

# unpack it
tar xvzf mano-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

# change into the extracted directory
cd mano-1.0.0/bin

# Make the daemon and the cli executable
chmod +x manod mano-cli

# copy them into the bin folder
cp manod mano-cli /usr/local/bin/

# change back to the home directory
cd ~

# run manod once to confirm it works (and also create a few files for us) 
manod

# Wait for a few moments for it to create the .manocoin directory and the configuration file and some other stuff
# Press Ctrl + c to stop the daemon

# Now edit the file mano.conf to configure the masternode
# Copy the following, edit it with your own settings and place it in your mano.conf configuration file

# ------------------- Beginning of the file .manocoin/mano.conf: ---------------------------------------------

rpcuser=YOURUSER
rpcpassword=YOURPASS
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
#----
listen=1
server=1
daemon=1
maxconnections=64
#----
masternode=1
masternodeprivkey=YOURKey
externalip=YOURIP:12777

# ------------------- End of the file ---------------------------------------------

# ------------------- Configuration settings: ---------------------------------------------
#
# rpcuser=YOURUSER (and YOURPASS) is a string, make it hard to guess: useru80uhl3kjhgo87hwh3goj 
# rpcpassword=YOURPASS
#
# externalip= the ip address of the machine running the masternode (your VPS)
# 	Find IP address: execute this command from the commandline on your masternode box: 
# 	hostname -I
# 	when your IP is: 80.70.60.50
# 	The line in mano.conf should read:
# 	externalip=80.70.60.50:12777
#
# masternodeprivkey= the private key you generated with 'masternode genkey' in the debug window of your QT wallet on your Windows/Mac machine:
#
# ------------------- End configuration settings  ---------------------------------------------

# To open and edit the configuration file:
nano .manocoin/mano.conf

# When you are done editing the mano.conf file, save it: 
# Press Ctrl+x and then 'y' for yes, followed by 'Enter'

# Start the daemon:
manod

# Note that as the network is still small... It may take a while before you begin syncing.
# Check if it has finished syncing:
mano-cli mnsync status

# Check the masternode status
mano-cli masternode status

# If 'mano-cli masternode status' produces the following, you are good:
# error: {"code":-1,"message":"Masternode not found in the list of available masternodes. Current status: Not capable masternode: Hot node, waiting for remote activation."}

# Now in your QT desktop wallet, open the debug console:
# Menu -> tools -> debug console
# Type: 
# masternode outputs
# it produces a result like this:
[
  {
    "txhash": "741b76d91a2f410744aaaeee8ddeeeef74d251f49754672777a8257c023575490222bb1cccefb39",
    "outputidx": 0
  }
]

# In the masternode.conf file you have create a line for your masternode in the following format:
# Format: alias IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
#
# Let's say your alias is 'mano1'
# your VPS's IP is 80.70.60.50
# The portnumber for mano is: 12777
# your masternodeprivkey is 93HaYCVGAUC88HF32223BGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg (produced by 'masternode genkey' earlier on)
# Your collateral_output_txid = txhash output from the 'masternode outputs' command you just typed, so: 741b76d91a2f410744aaaeee8ddeeeef74d251f49754672777a8257c023575490222bb1cccefb39
# the collateral_output_index is the outputidx from the 'masternode outputs' command, so: 0
#
# The line in the masternode.conf will look like this:
# mano1 80.70.60.50:12777 93HaYCVGAUC88HF32223BGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 741b76d91a2f410744aaaeee8ddeeeef74d251f49754672777a8257c023575490222bb1cccefb39 0

# Open the masternode.conf of your QT Mano desktop wallet by selecting:
# tools -> Open masternode configuration file
# paste the line at the end of the file, 
# save the file and restart (quit and then start again) the QT Mano wallet


#  When the mano wallet has started again, open the debug console:
# Menu -> tools -> debug console
#  Start the masternode:
# startmasternode alias false mano1

# If it shows that the result is succesful, your masternode is running!
#
# {
#   "overall": "Successfully started 1 masternodes, failed to start 0, total 1",
#   "detail": [
#     {
#       "alias": "mano1",
#       "result": "successful"
#     }
#   ]
# }


# You can verify if it is running on the VPS by typing:
mano-cli masternode status

# To clean up 
# You don't need the downloaded files anymore so:
cd ~
rm mano-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
rm -rf mano-1.0.0
#
# Good luck!
#
# Peace!
